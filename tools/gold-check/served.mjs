// Drives the adjudication page as it is actually served, and fails if an answer does not reach
// the disk.
//
// `check.mjs` opens the page as a file, where the browser is the only copy. `steamgauge gold
// --serve` is the way the page is meant to be run, and there the promise is stronger: every
// answer is on disk before the next question is drawn, and reopening the page anywhere carries
// on from the file rather than from this browser's storage. That promise has a failure mode
// nobody would notice until it mattered, because a POST that silently does nothing looks
// exactly like one that worked.
//
// The server here stands in for the Rust one, which is unit tested separately. What is being
// checked is the page's half of the contract.
//
//   cargo run -p steamgauge-core --example sample-gold -- gold.html
