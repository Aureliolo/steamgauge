//! Does every reading say what its own rows hold?
//!
//! A reading is two artefacts written by one pass: `reading.json`, which holds the counts every
//! rate and report is built from, and `readings.parquet`, which holds one row per claim. Nothing
//! else checks that they agree, and a pass that counted a review twice, or lost its place inside
//! one, would leave a corpus that reads perfectly and is wrong.
//!
//! Four things have to hold, and each is a different way for the walk to have gone wrong:
//! the rows are as many as the claims counted, the rows with no subject are as many as the
//! claims declined, each review's rows sit together and are numbered from zero, and the reviews
//! in the rows plus the reviews the splitter found nothing in are the reviews counted.
