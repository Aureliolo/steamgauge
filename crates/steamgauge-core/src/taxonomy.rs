//! The fixed core spine of categories.
//!
//! These are the categories that stay the same across every game, so numbers from different
//! corpora can be compared. Game-specific categories are induced separately and layered on
//! top; nothing here is meant to describe any particular game well.
//!
//! Each category carries a *description written the way a review would say it*, not an
//! abstract label. The classifier compares review vectors against these descriptions, and
//! embedding models place "the frame rate tanks in cities" much nearer to a sentence about
//! stuttering than to the word "performance".
//!
//! A category also carries a **boundary rule**, which is written for whoever is labelling
//! and is deliberately never embedded. Rules are about how to choose between two categories
//! and read like instructions; feeding "prefer difficulty when the complaint is about
//! balance" to an embedding model would drag the anchor towards the vocabulary of
//! instructions and away from the vocabulary of reviews.

Every claim label is six fields.

subject
  The one category this claim is about. Exactly one, always. Most claims name no aspect at
  all: those are `verdict` if they judge the game and `offtopic` if they do not.

polarity
  What the claim does about its subject, in one of these words: {polarity}. Praise and
  complaint are about the game, not about the reviewer's mood. Neutral is for a claim that
  states something without judging it, which is common and is not a failure to decide.

ironic
  The text says the opposite of what it appears to say. \"0/10, I have not slept in three
  days\" is praise; \"10/10 would lose my save file again\" is a complaint. Judge this from
  the words alone. You are not told whether the reviewer recommended the game, so that you
  cannot be led by it. Where a claim is ironic, `polarity` is what the reviewer MEANS.

confidence
  How sure you are of the subject, in one of these words: {confidence}. This one is about
  you, and it is used: the model is trained against your uncertainty rather than against a
  flattened guess, so a truthful \"low\" is worth more than a confident wrong answer.

ambiguous
  Whether the call is genuinely contested: two subjects fit and the rules above do not settle
  which. This is about the claim and the taxonomy rather than about you, and it is read back.
  Agreement is reported separately over the claims marked here.

split_wrong
  Whether this claim is really two points stuck together, or half of one that was cut in the
  wrong place. The splitting is mechanical and it will be wrong sometimes; this is the only
  signal that it was, and it is what improves it. Leave it false unless the text in front of
  you is genuinely mis-cut.

Return every one of these for every claim, in the order the claims are given. A judgement left
out is not a judgement, and a label missing one is refused rather than filled in with a guess.
";

/// What every label carries besides its categories.
///
/// Generated with the categories and for the same reason. The boundaries were written down
/// because labellers disagreed about them; these were left to whatever each batch was told,
/// and one of them decides how a headline figure is reported. `ambiguous` is what splits
/// agreement into clear-cut and contested, and across the core-3 sets it marked between 21%
/// and 35% of a game depending on who labelled it, which is a spread no property of the
/// reviews explains.
///
/// `ironic` is a claim about the words, not about the rating. The labeller is never shown
/// whether the reviewer recommended the game, so that they cannot be led by it, which means
/// they cannot report that the two disagree either. They say what the text does; joining
/// that to the rating is arithmetic and belongs to the tool.
const FIELDS: &str = "\
Every label is five fields. The first two say which categories the review covers; the other
three are judgements about the review, and none of them changes which category it belongs to.

primary
  The one category the review is most about. Exactly one, always.

secondary
  Every other category the review genuinely also covers. Leave it empty when the review is
  about one thing. Never add a category to fill space.

ironic
  The text says the opposite of what it appears to say. \"0/10, I have not slept in three
  days\" is praise; \"10/10 would lose my save file again\" is a complaint. Judge this from
  the words alone. You are not told whether the reviewer recommended the game, so that you
  cannot be led by it.

confidence
  How sure you are of the primary category, in one of these words: {confidence}.
  This one is about you.

ambiguous
  Whether the call is genuinely contested: two categories fit and the rules above do not
  settle which. This one is about the review and the taxonomy rather than about you, and it
  is the judgement that is read back. Agreement is reported separately for the reviews
  marked here, because disagreement on them says as much about the taxonomy as about the
  classifier.

Return every one of these for every review. A judgement left out is not a judgement, and a
label missing one is refused rather than filled in with a guess: ironic and ambiguous are
claims about the review, and defaulting them to false would put words in your mouth on the
figure that decides how agreement is reported.
