//! Drawing a sample that covers a corpus rather than one that resembles it.
//!
//! A random sample of a million reviews is mostly "great game" and "10/10", because that is
//! what a million reviews mostly are, and a reader hoping to find what this game's players
//! talk about that other games' do not would see none of it. What that reader wants is the
//! opposite of representative: a handful of reviews chosen so that each says something the
//! others do not.
//!
//! Farthest-point traversal does that. Start anywhere, then repeatedly take the review whose
//! vector is farthest from everything already taken. The exact version is quadratic in the
//! corpus, which for a million reviews is a week; this one walks a bounded pool of candidates
//! drawn by hash, which is the same draw for the same corpus and seed, and takes the farthest
//! from that. The pool is a few thousand, which is enough to hold every neighbourhood a
//! corpus has and small enough that the traversal is seconds.
