//! The claims a person adjudicates, and the page they do it on.
//!
//! Everything measured so far is a model agreeing with a model. The README says so and no
//! citation can rest on it. What turns a silver set into a gold one is a person reading the
//! claims themselves, and the only reason that has not happened is that there was nothing to
//! read them on.
//!
//! Two draws, because they answer different questions:
//!
//! - **Blind.** A random sample of frozen claims with no answer shown, which is the only kind
//!   of reading that produces an accuracy figure rather than a ratification.
//! - **Split.** The claims two labellers answered differently, with both answers shown, which
//!   is what settles a boundary rather than measuring one.
//!
//! The page is one self-contained file that fetches nothing and sends nothing. It holds review
//! text, so it is written outside the repository and never committed, exactly like a report.
