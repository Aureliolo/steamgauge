//! Rendering a report as one self-contained page.
//!
//! Self-contained is the whole constraint. No fonts, no scripts, no stylesheets from
//! anywhere: a corpus that never left the machine must not start leaving it the moment
//! somebody looks at it, and a page that phones out is also a page that stops working when
//! the network does or when the host it depended on goes away.
//!
//! The page answers one question in three widening steps. A sentence says what reading only
//! the top of the pile would have told you and what everyone actually said. A table gives
//! every category the same treatment. Every row opens onto the reviews it counted, each
//! linking back to Steam, because a rate nobody can check is just an assertion.
