//! Subjects a game's own players raise that the fixed taxonomy has no row for.
//!
//! The spine is the floor, not the ceiling. A truck simulator's players talk about mud
//! physics and a horror game's about jump scares, and neither is a row every game shares. A
//! language model reads the diverse handout for a game and names what it finds; this is the
//! shape of what it hands back, and the checks that stop a hallucinated subject reaching a
//! report.
//!
//! The check is evidence. Every induced subject has to name the reviews in the handout that
//! raise it, by id, and a subject that names reviews not in the handout, or fewer than a
//! handful, is refused. A model asked for subjects will produce subjects; the reviews are what
//! make them a finding about the game rather than a list.
