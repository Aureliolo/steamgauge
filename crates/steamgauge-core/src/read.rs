//! Reading a whole corpus, one claim at a time.
//!
//! One walk over the capture. Every distinct claim is asked about, and a review is added up as
//! soon as the model has answered the claims it holds. Distinct rather than every claim because
//! "Great game." is one claim written a thousand times, and reading it a thousand times is a
//! thousand times the electricity for the same answer.
//!
//! What comes out is deliberately three different shapes of number, and the difference
//! matters more than any of them:
//!
//! - **Mention rate**: the share of reviews raising a subject. A review counts once however
//!   many claims it makes about it, so nobody's verbosity moves it. This is the headline.
//! - **Polarity**: per review, per subject, as praised, criticised or mixed. A review that
//!   loves the art and hates the framerate says two things and is recorded as saying two.
//! - **Claim share**: the share of all claims. Verbosity-weighted, useful for reading,
//!   never a headline, and labelled wherever it appears.
