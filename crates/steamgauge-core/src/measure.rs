//! Comparing what the model read against what a labeller said.

//! A census that cannot say how often it is wrong is an opinion with decimal places. This is
//! where the figure comes from: stored readings joined to a claim reference set, per subject,
//! with the two things that make the number honest kept separate from it.
//!
//! The first is **abstention**. The model declines claims it is not sure about, and a score
//! that quietly drops those is a score for a classifier nobody is running. Declined claims are
//! counted and reported, and the agreement figure says over how many it was computed.
//!
//! The second is **contest**. A labeller marks a claim ambiguous when two subjects genuinely
//! both fit and the rules do not settle which. Agreement on those says as much about the
//! taxonomy as about the model, so it is reported apart from the rest rather than averaged in.
