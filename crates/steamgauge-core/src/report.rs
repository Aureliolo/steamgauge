//! Gathering everything a readable report needs, without re-reading the corpus.
//!
//! The counts come from the sidecar the reading pass writes, so a report never recomputes a
//! pass that has already run and can never disagree with the run it claims to describe.
//!
//! What the sidecar cannot hold is review text. A report that says 14% of reviews complain
//! about performance is a claim a reader should be able to check, so a bounded, deterministic
//! handful of the claims behind every number is fetched from the capture and shown. Bounded
//! because a million reviews will not fit in a page; deterministic because two runs against
//! the same corpus should show the same evidence.
//!
//! The evidence is claims rather than whole reviews, because a claim is what the count is made
//! of. Quoting the review would ask a reader to find the sentence that earned the subject, and
//! on a long review that sentence is one of thirty.
