//! A batch is a review with its claims numbered, never a heap of loose claims. Two reasons.
//! A claim on its own is often unreadable ("it doesn't", "same here", "this one too"), and

//! once with its claims enumerated costs a fraction of sending the review again for every
//! claim it contains.
