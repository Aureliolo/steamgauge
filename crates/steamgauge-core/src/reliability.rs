//! Two labellers on the same claims, and how far apart they are.
//!
//! Every figure this tool reports rests on labels one model wrote, and a set labelled once
//! cannot say anything about its own reliability. A tenth of it is labelled a second time by a
//! different labeller, and this is what reads the two together.
//!
//! Raw agreement is not enough on its own. A corpus is mostly `verdict` and `offtopic`, so two
//! labellers who never read a claim would still agree most of the time by landing on the
//! commonest subject. Cohen's kappa subtracts that: it asks how much of the agreement is more
//! than the two labellers' own habits would produce by chance.
//!
//! The fields are reported apart from each other because they fail differently. Subject is a
//! judgement about the claim; `ambiguous` is a judgement about the taxonomy, and the labelled
//! sets so far disagree about it far more than they disagree about anything else.
