//! Splitting a review into the separate points it makes.
//!
//! A review is not one opinion. "Looks incredible, runs like a slideshow, and the story is
//! the best in the series" is three, about three different things, and a single vector for
//! the whole review is their average: a point in embedding space that belongs to none of
//! them. Every category a review touches has to be reachable, and averaging is what puts a
//! long multi-topic review nearest to nothing in particular.
//!
//! The split is deliberately mechanical. It knows about sentence terminators in the scripts
//! reviews are written in and nothing else: no grammar, no model, no language detection. A
//! wrong split costs one claim landing in the wrong category, which is measurable. A model
//! here would cost a second thing to keep honest.
