"""What the trained reader has to beat, measured the same way it is.

Three baselines over the same split, the same games and the same selective-prediction
protocol, because a number with nothing beside it says only that the thing runs:

- **The commonest subject.** The floor. Anything that cannot beat it has learned nothing, and
  on a set where one subject is a quarter of the claims it is not as low a floor as it sounds.
- **Bag of words.** TF-IDF over words and character n-grams into a linear model. Multilingual
  by accident rather than by design, trains in seconds, and is the honest thing to beat: if a
  278M-parameter encoder cannot clear it, it is not earning its electricity.
- **Nearest subject centroid over the untuned backbone.** What this project did before it
  trained anything, and the reason it stopped: cosine distance to a prototype has no way to
  say "this is about nothing", so it answers every claim including "gfg".
