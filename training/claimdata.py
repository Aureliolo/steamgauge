"""Loading labelled claims, and splitting them so a number means something.

The split is the part worth reading twice. Claims from one game are not independent of each
other, so a random split would put a reviewer's own words on both sides of it and report a
score the model cannot repeat on a game it has never seen. Games are therefore split whole.

Three parts, and they have different jobs:

  train        what the model learns from
  validation   what every choice is made against: thresholds, epochs, backbone
  test         frozen before the first run and read once, at the end

Anything tuned against the test part stops being a measurement, so nothing here returns it
except `held_out`, and nothing calls that until there is a number to publish.
