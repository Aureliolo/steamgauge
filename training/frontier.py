"""Asks a frontier model the same question the reader is asked, and scores the answers.

The other baselines are things a frontier model obviously beats. This is the one that might
beat the trained reader, and until it is run the claim that a fine-tuned 278M encoder is worth
having is an assertion. Same claims, same category sheet the labellers worked from, same
review around each claim, and the same abstention: a model that may say "unsure" is measured
on coverage as well as accuracy, exactly as the reader is.

The handout deliberately carries no labels and no game names. A model told which game it is
reading can lean on what it knows about that game rather than on what the claim says, and the
reader cannot.
