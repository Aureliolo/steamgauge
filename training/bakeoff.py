"""Decides the backbone by measurement rather than by reputation.

Every candidate sees the same claims, the same split and the same schedule, and is judged on
two things together: how well it reads a claim, and how fast it reads thirteen million of
them. A model two points better and three times slower is not better here.

The encoder this project already ships was chosen the same way, as an embedder. That is a
different job from classifying, which is why it does not get to keep the position unmeasured.
