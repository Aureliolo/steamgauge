"""Fine-tunes a multilingual encoder to read one claim.

Two heads on a shared trunk: which subject the claim is about, and whether it is praise, a
complaint, or neither. One forward pass produces both, plus the pooled vector the clustering
uses, which is the reason for fine-tuning the encoder rather than bolting a classifier onto a
frozen one.

The loss is weighted by the labeller's own confidence. A claim they called "low" moves the
model less than one they called "high", because throwing that away and training on a flattened
id discards the only thing the annotator said about their own uncertainty.
