"""Publishes an exported run to Hugging Face, and pins it in the tool in the same motion.

Two things go up. The model: the graph, its tokenizer and reader.json, with the card the
export wrote. And the dataset it was trained from: review ids, claim offsets and labels, and
never the text, because this repository holds no review data and neither will that one.

Publishing without pinning would be the one thing worse than not publishing. The tool fetches
the reader by checksum, so a model uploaded and not pinned is a model nobody can use, and a
model pinned by hand is a hash somebody typed. This computes the hashes from the exact bytes
it uploaded and writes them into reader.rs.

    python publish.py --run runs/wave2 --model-repo <user>/steam-review-claim-reader \
        --data-repo <user>/steam-review-claims

Needs a Hugging Face token with write access, from `huggingface-cli login` or HF_TOKEN.
