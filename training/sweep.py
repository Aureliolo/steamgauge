"""Every training run on one set of labels, ranked, with the interval around each figure.

A sweep produces one number per configuration and the temptation is to read the largest one as
the winner. Most of the gaps are smaller than the noise, and there are two kinds of noise, one
of them much larger than the other. Scoring one finished model on 2,615 validation claims puts
about two points of uncertainty on any coverage figure. Training the same configuration again,
changing nothing but the seed, moves it four. So this prints the interval beside each figure
and the measured spread between seeds beneath the table, because the second is the bar a change
has to clear. It also refuses to put two runs in one table unless they were trained on the same
labels, since a run on more labels is not a better configuration.

    python sweep.py                     # every run on the current labels, best first
    python sweep.py --against win-128   # what each run changed, and what it bought
    python sweep.py --subjects lr5e5    # where one run wins and loses, subject by subject
    python sweep.py --frozen            # what the saved runs promised and what they delivered

Coverage is the headline because the promise is fixed: the reader answers at the accuracy it
promised or it abstains, so the configuration that answers more claims at the same promise is
the better one.
