# Gaps the claim labellers reported

Collected as they finish, the same way the core-3 gaps became core-4. Nothing here is acted on
mid-run: changing the sheet while half a set is labelled leaves the other half labelled against
a taxonomy it never saw. These get applied in one revision, `core-6` and `claims-4` together,
after the 36-game run is labelled and measured, and the sets are redrawn against both.

Ordered by how many labellers reported the same thing without being able to see each other's
work, which is the only evidence any of it has. The second reading adds a different kind of
evidence: where two labellers given the same sheet disagree on the subject, the sheet is what
failed. Their commonest disagreements, over 1,400 claims read twice across thirty games, are
`difficulty` against `gameplay` (25), `genre` against `verdict` (14), `updates` against
`verdict` (10), `atmosphere` against `verdict` (9) and `content` against `verdict` (8). Every
one of those is below.

## Defects in the sheet, to fix in the next revision

### `verdict` contradicts itself about money: found in the core-5 run

The `verdict` description offers "worth every penny" and "waste of money" as examples, and the
`verdict` RULE says "super fun, worth every penny" is `price`. A labeller cannot follow both.
`price` owns "value for money" by its own description, so the examples are the mistake: both
phrases judge value and belong to `price`. The rule's example is also poorly chosen, since
"super fun" is gameplay rather than price.

Not fixed mid-run, because changing the sheet while half a set is labelled leaves the other
half labelled against a different one. Labellers are marking these `ambiguous`, so the data
records the uncertainty rather than hiding it.

The revision, ready to apply in `taxonomy.rs` when the run ends: drop "worth every penny" and
"waste of money" from the `verdict` examples; change the RULE's example to "super fun, and
the story is great" belongs to `story`; and add "worth every penny", "waste of money" and
"refunded it" to the `price` examples, which is where the second reading found labellers
already putting them when they disagreed.

### `controls` and `accessibility` both claim key remapping: reported on 920210

`controls` lists "keybindings" and `accessibility` lists "remappable controls", and neither
has a RULE pointing at the other, so "I wish I could remap the keys" fits both descriptions
and the labeller flagged every one. The line the sheet already draws elsewhere is between
the thing and the option for it: how the keys are laid out and whether they respond is
`controls`; whether the game lets you change them is `accessibility`, which is where "the
settings players need in order to play at all" already points. The revision adds that
sentence as a RULE on `controls`.

## Needs a rule, not a category

### Comparison with the predecessor: three reports, two eras

"Not as good as the first game", "FP1 was a class", "completely different from the original",
"best Anno yet". Reported by both claim labellers and by the review-level labellers before them.
It currently scatters between `genre` (comparison to other games), `verdict` (better or worse)
and `offtopic` (a statement purely about the older game). Labellers marked nearly all of it
contested, which is the definition of a boundary the taxonomy has not settled.

A one-line RULE on `genre` would absorb most of it: a comparison with the game's own
predecessor is `genre` when the difference itself is the point, and `verdict` when it is only
better or worse.

**Reported by all three labellers on 2338770**, a yearly sports title: "exact same game as
last year, copy-paste, a reskin" is the commonest complaint in that set and sits between
`genre` (the predecessor comparison), `content` (nothing new in it) and `updates` (nothing
changed). All three filed it `genre` and flagged it. The rule above covers it once it says so:
a yearly release judged against last year's is the predecessor case, whatever the wording.
The same set raised "PC only gets the last-gen version", between `policy` (the publisher's
decision), `compatibility` (what this platform gets) and `updates`; two labellers went one
way and one the other. A decision about which platform gets which build is `policy`; how the
build runs on this machine is `compatibility`.

**The same seam with a rival rather than a predecessor**, reported on 1665460 ("better than
FIFA") and 1716740 ("worse than Freelancer", "like Fallout 4 without the exploration"). The
proposed RULE names only the game's own predecessor, so labellers split a comparison with
another studio's game between `genre` and `verdict` and flagged it. The rule should say
"another game" rather than "its predecessor": the difference named is `genre`, better or worse
alone is `verdict`.

### Praise or blame for the studio that is not about patches: five reports

"Applaud the devs for taking a risk", "hope Bandai sells the IP", "director replacement is
urgent", "fix this 11 bit", and on 2357570 and 2669320 a wall of bare insults at Blizzard and
EA. `updates` is written around post-release patching and `policy` around the publisher and
the platform, so a judgement of the studio itself lands in neither, and both labellers filed
it under `updates` and flagged every one. The revision gives `updates` a second sentence:
praise or blame aimed at the studio as a whole, with no patch, decision or term named, is
`updates`; a named decision is `policy`.

### A patch that removed content: one report, and it was most of that game

Skullgirls' 2023 censorship patch (245170) is the bulk of its set: "not what I paid for",
"content removed", "woke devs". `updates` (a patch changed the game) against `policy` ("terms
that changed after people had bought it"), and the labeller flagged every one that framed it
as the owner's decision. The RULE proposed above for the studio settles this the same way: a
patch is `updates`; the decision behind it, where the claim names it, is `policy`.

### Cannot log in: one report

"Can't log in", "needs a phone number to play", on 2357570. `bugs` when the login is broken,
`policy` when the requirement is the complaint, and the labeller could not always tell which
the reviewer meant. Related to the "will not start" gap below and settled by the same rule.

### A publisher's decision reversed, celebrated in memes: one report, a tenth of that game

Helldivers 2 (553850) after Sony withdrew the account requirement: "DEMOCRACY HAS
PREVAILED", "we won", "For Democracy". The words say nothing about the game and the context
says `policy`, praise; the labeller filed most `offtopic` at low confidence and marked them
ambiguous, which is the honest reading of a sheet that has no line for it. The revision adds
one to `policy`: a celebration or a protest of something the publisher or platform did is
`policy`, praise or complaint by which it was, however it is phrased. The same set held
anti-cheat complaints between `policy` (the kernel driver is the objection) and
`multiplayer` (it blocks joining), settled by the existing line: what a decision is is
`policy`, what it does when playing is where it does it.

### Luck that is sold: one report

FC 25's pack luck (2669320) is `monetisation` (loot boxes) and `difficulty` (luck deciding the
outcome) at once, and "scripting" (the game decides you lose) is `difficulty` by the
fairness clause and reads as a `bugs` accusation. The labeller filed both under `difficulty`
and flagged them. A RULE on `monetisation`: what a purchase gives you is `monetisation`, how
it plays once you have it is whatever it is about.

### A balance change blamed on a patch: one report, and it dominated that game

Tekken 8's set (1778820) is mostly Season 2 complaints, where one sentence names a balance
problem (`difficulty`), the mechanic it broke (`gameplay`) and the patch that did it
(`updates`). The labeller filed the balance under `difficulty` and the blame under `updates`
and marked most of them contested. A RULE on `updates` would settle it: a complaint about what
a patch changed is about the change (`difficulty`, `gameplay`, `content`); `updates` is for
the patching itself, its pace, and whether the developers listen.

### The alien that cannot be fought, and the commonest disagreement between labellers

"You can't fight back", the alien's AI on 214490, parry windows, enemy spam and damage
sponges on 1809540: `gameplay` against `difficulty` every time, and the sheet's `difficulty`
rule ("how hard, and whether it is fair") does not say whether an enemy's behaviour is a
mechanic or a difficulty. One line would: an enemy's design is `gameplay`; how hard it is to
beat is `difficulty`.

This is now the largest gap the second reading finds: **25 of the 183 subject disagreements**
over 1,400 claims read twice, ahead of every other pair, and it appears in six games rather
than one. Skullgirls mixups, Nine Sols boss readability, Frostpunk 2 faction exploits and Old
World's AI bonuses are all the same shape: a mechanic described through how hard it makes the
game. The rule above settles each of them, and it is the first line `core-6` should carry.

### Faithful to the film: one report, a third of that game's contested claims

"Captures the feeling of the original film", "true to the movie", on 214490. Between
`licensing` (faithful to the thing it adapts), `atmosphere` (the feeling itself) and
`verdict`. The `licensing` description already says "how faithful the game is to the thing it
is adapting", so the sheet has an answer and the labeller did not trust it against
`atmosphere`. A RULE on `atmosphere` pointing at `licensing` for faithfulness would do.

**Reported again 2026-09-11**, independently, by the frontier model reading 471 frozen claims
for the baseline: it named this the single unclearest boundary on the sheet, because such
claims "usually lead with atmosphere words" and the sheet sends faithfulness to `licensing`.
Two readers who could not see each other's work naming the same boundary is the strongest
evidence in this file, and the rule is still not written.

### A real competition that is missing: two reports, on the licensing draws

"No Liga MX", "no World Cup mode", "add the Czech league", "the national teams are gone", on
1665460 and 2669320, the sets drawn to teach the `licensing` row. The RULE says a real name
missing is `licensing`, and `content` says wanting more game is `content`; a missing league
is both, and each labeller drew the line in a different place: one at teams and leagues
against tournaments and modes, the other at "very realistic football" against anything named.
Both flagged nearly all of it. The rule that settles it: a named real-world team, league,
competition or player that is absent, wrong or generic is `licensing` however it is phrased;
`content` keeps only a mode or feature that names nothing real.

### A VR complaint whose cause is not the headset: reported by the frontier reader

Claims about stutter over wireless streaming, or about a mod that makes a flat game playable
in VR, sit between `vr`, `performance` and `mods` with nothing to choose between them. The
`vr` row is about playing in VR; it does not say whether a VR-specific performance problem is
`vr` or `performance`, and the same question will arise for every VR game added. With two VR
games now drawn (546560, 438100), this stops being hypothetical.

**Reported again by a claim labeller on 1716740**, from the other side: physics-driven hands
(an item misaligned in the grip, a crouch that does not register, a rifle stock that
jitters) sit between `controls` ("clunky controls"), `vr` ("the controllers in your hands")
and `gameplay`, and neither RULE settles which owns a hand interaction. The line to draw:
anything that exists only because the player's body is tracked is `vr`; the same complaint
about a gamepad or a mouse is `controls`.

### A claim that carries two subjects because it was cut wrong

Not a taxonomy gap but a splitter one, reported by the frontier reader as the largest single
source of its own low-confidence answers: checkbox-template rows, pros-and-cons lists, and
"great X, but Y" arrive as one claim carrying two subjects. It took the head of the claim
except where a "but" clause carried the conclusion. The `split_wrong` flag exists for exactly
this and is set on a sixth of the set; what is missing is a rule saying which half to label
when it happens, so that two labellers make the same choice.

### Cutscenes that cannot be skipped: one report

Filed under `gameplay` at low confidence on 1809540. It is a `controls` question by the
sheet's "how many clicks it takes to do anything", and nothing says so.

### A game that will not start, with no reason given: two reports

"Bought it, installed it, cannot run it". Splits between `bugs` and `compatibility` with
nothing to choose between them.

## Might need a category

### Lost immersion, emotional distance: three reports, the commonest complaint in one set

"They are just numbers now", "lost its soul", "you cannot feel the people any more", "death is
a statistic". Sits between `story` and `gameplay` and the rules do not settle it. This was the
single most frequent complaint in the Frostpunk 2 pilot, so it is not a rare shape.

Related to the atmosphere and fear gap the review-level labellers reported six times across
two horror games. Both are about what a game makes a player feel rather than about any part
that produces it. One category might take both.

**`atmosphere` was added for this in `core-5` and is holding up.** Measured 2026-09-11 over
the 205 atmosphere claims in the frozen games, the reader scores F1 0.55 on it, which is the
middle of the table and the same as `gameplay` scores on twenty times the labels. It is not
one of the broken rows; those are all under about 150 labels. The claims it does miss go to
`audio`, `graphics` and `verdict`, which is the boundary this entry was always about, so
boundary text naming what atmosphere is not would still be worth writing. It is a refinement
rather than a rescue.

### Mods and user content: the most-reported gap there is

Five games in the review era (Blade and Sorcery, Beat Saber, Helldivers 2, Cyberpunk 2077,
SnowRunner) and now three more at claim level, on 1385380, 1465360 and 1592190, where one
labeller called modding "the game's dominant theme" and had to file it under `content` at low
confidence with every claim marked contested. Falls between `content`, `updates` and
`community` with no rule choosing.

The model agrees, without having been asked. On the labelled claims of the three frozen games
under the fifteen-game reader, 1466860 is the one it declines most of, 80% against 61% on the
least, and it is the one where modding is the dominant theme. A subject the spine lacks is a
subject the model cannot commit to. Over the whole corpus the gap is softer, 72.9% against a
usual 73.2%, because the labelled sample is stratified towards subject-bearing claims and
shows it more sharply. Still two independent measurements pointing at one missing row.

Eight games is not a boundary dispute, it is a subject. The revision adds `mods`: "Mods and
user-made content. Whether the game supports them, how easy they are to install, what the
community has made, and whether the game is worth playing without them. A game that is
better modded than shipped is a statement about mods, not about content." With a RULE on
`content` sending anything user-made here.

### Playing with friends: three reports, and it dominated two games

"Better with friends", "fun with mates", "does not grab you alone". Not servers or matchmaking
(`multiplayer`), not calling it a co-op game (`genre`), and not a bare verdict. It was the
commonest qualified claim in DEVOUR's set, BeamNG's labeller (228380) hit the same three
ways of filing it, and Deep Rock Galactic's (548430) split it between `multiplayer` when the
point is solo against co-op and `verdict` when the friends are incidental. "The game is dead"
is its cousin, between `multiplayer` (nobody online) and `updates` (nobody developing), and
the same labeller marked it contested.

### A community's salute on its own: one report, forty claims

"Rock and Stone!", about forty times in Deep Rock Galactic's set, sometimes as the whole
review. It works as an endorsement and passes no judgement in its words, so the labeller
filed it `offtopic`, neutral, and marked every one ambiguous. A reader who knows the game
reads it as praise; the sheet says `offtopic` is for what a reader learns nothing from. The
revision decides it in one line under `verdict`: a community's own catchphrase used as a
salute is a verdict, and it is praise. Twenty games have one ("Praise the Sun", "For Rock and
Stone", "Ave Nex Alea"), and `offtopic` is the wrong bucket for a reviewer declaring
themselves a fan.

### Destruction and physics: one report, and it is what that game is

BeamNG's damage deformation is a system, and reviewers praise how it looks. Sits on the
`gameplay` and `graphics` line, filed `gameplay` and marked contested nearly every time. A
spine row will not fix a game whose whole point is one mechanic; this is what the induced
subjects are for, and 228380 is a good second game to run the induction on.

## Confirmed by the core-5 run

`atmosphere` works. On the first horror game labelled against it, it took 40 of 118
aspect-naming claims, nearly every "scary" and "I peed myself" among them. Before it existed
those fell to `verdict` or were scattered across `graphics` and `audio`.

### A verdict that names the genre as a noun: three reports, and the labels measured

"Excellent city builder", "among the best platformers", "great platformer in every way". The
`verdict` rule says any named aspect wins and `genre` owns naming what kind of game it is, so
these are forced to `genre` while reading as bare verdicts. Labellers flagged nearly all of
them contested. The sheet should say whether a genre noun counts as naming an aspect.

Measured on 2026-09-12 across the 18,907 labels then exported: the sheet already says a
judgement with only the kind of game attached is a `verdict`, and of the 152 claims that name
a kind of game *and* carry a judgement word, labellers wrote `genre` 57 times and `verdict`
33. Two to one against the rule as written. The reader learns the labels and repeats it:
`verdict` and `genre` are the second largest confusion in the whole out-of-fold matrix, 248
claims over twenty-eight games. Stating the principle was not enough, so the revision wants
the counter-example beside it: "a great roguelike" is `verdict`, "it is a roguelike" is
`genre`, and the test is whether removing the judgement leaves a claim that still says
something.

### How much story there is: five subjects for one question

Of the 624 labelled claims that contain a story word, 35 also say something about length, and
those went to `content` (7), `story` (5), `gameplay` (4), `difficulty` (4) and `verdict` (3).
No majority. The rule exists and lives in the wrong entry: `gameplay` says "how much game
there is belongs to content", and the `story` entry says nothing about amount at all. A rule
under one category is applied by labellers reading that category's paragraph and not
otherwise. The reader keys on the word: out of fold, `story` predictions are right 58% of the
time and 95 of its mistakes were labelled `gameplay`, among them "the main story seemed
fairly short" and "you're going down a predetermined path".

The revision: the `story` boundary gains "how much story there is belongs to content, the same
way how much game there is does; this is what the narrative is and whether it is worth
following".

### Balance complaints that name a mechanic: the rule is followed half the time

The `difficulty` boundary is explicit that balance complaints belong there rather than to
`gameplay`, *including when they name a specific mechanic as overpowered or useless*. Of the
97 labelled claims that say something is overpowered, nerfed, buffed or unbalanced, 50 went
to `difficulty` and 18 to `gameplay`. This is the largest disagreement between the two
labellers (25 of 1,400 claims read twice) and the largest confusion the reader has (357 claims
out of fold, both directions). The sheet already says it, so no edit; this is the boundary
the adjudication settles, and the 192 split claims in front of the adjudicator hold it by
name.

**Reported by all four labellers on 1449850**, a card game, without seeing each other's
work: "I sit and watch the opponent combo for ten minutes and cannot do anything" is the
commonest complaint in that set and each labeller split it differently between `gameplay`
(the turn structure that allows it), `difficulty` (going first wins, an unstoppable board)
and `multiplayer` (what playing against people is like). The sheet's balance rule covers the
second reading; the first and third are the same claim seen from the mechanic and from the
opponent, and a rule that says a complaint about what other players are allowed to do is
`difficulty` when it is about winning and `multiplayer` when it is about the experience of
the match would cut it. Every card and fighting game will raise it.

### Addictive, could not stop playing: one report, a dozen claims

Filed under `atmosphere` by its "pulls you in, lose whole evenings" example, but it reads as a
verdict to many. A single line would settle it either way.

### Pure emotional reaction with nothing named: two reports

"Made me cry", "the feels", "I'm scared", "AHHH". Sits between `atmosphere` and `story`, and
the polarity is about the reviewer rather than the game, which the sheet says polarity is not.

## Smaller, one report each

- Pre-order regret ("I who pre-ordered deluxe am a clown") fits neither `price` nor
  `monetisation` squarely.
- "I refunded it" is listed under `price` but reads as a verdict.
- Complaints about world plausibility ("how does XIX-century tech forecast a storm 88 weeks
  out") fit neither `story` nor `gameplay`.
- A reviewer's own hardware ("using an RTX 3070") sits between `compatibility` and
  `performance`.
- Neutral narrative lines inside a long bug report have nowhere to go but `bugs`.

## Splitter, not taxonomy

Both labellers flagged these through `split_wrong`, and they are fixed in `claims-2` and
`claims-3`: bullet markers, numbered list markers, headings ending in a colon, semicolons,
quotations, parenthetical asides, Steam markup, and web addresses.

### The comma list, reported by five labellers and counting

"Stunning visual, calm music, epic story". "Great story and the sound design is top notch".
"Music 9/10 Buildings 9/10". "Runs well, isn't misrepresented, just not for me". Three subjects
in one claim, so the labeller picks one and marks it contested, and two subjects go uncounted.

This looks fixable after all, and precisely: split on a comma only when the sentence is three
or more comma-separated parts that are each *short*, measured in the same weight the splitter
already uses so it works in scripts without spaces. "Stunning visual, calm music, epic story"
is three parts of weight 14, 10 and 10 and splits; "The combat, which took a while to click, is
superb" has a long middle and does not.

**Done in `claims-4`**, mid-run after all, because a label now names a span of its review
rather than an index, and `steamgauge measure-claims` joins by span: a labelled claim the new
splitter cuts differently is counted as unjoined rather than silently scored against the
wrong sentence. Three or more comma-separated parts, each of weight 6 to 18, split; the cut
happens after the fragments are joined, or the short parts would be joined straight back.
Readings record the splitter that cut them, and a reading cut by an older one is refused
wherever a claim is quoted or scored by its index, until the game is read again.

### A question and its answer are one claim, reported on 1601580

The worst-split game so far, 165 of 697. Two shapes the splitter has never seen. Rhetorical
question-and-answer pairs: "Is this Frost Punk?" / "No. Is this a phenomenal game?" and "Want
to see your objectives?" / "Top left of the screen." And the inline scorecard: "Visuals?
fantastic!" / ", Atmosphere?" / "fantastic!, Story?" / "mid at best, Balance?", one review
shredded into fragments that mean nothing apart.

The rule: a question mark followed by a short answer, a few words ending in a full stop or an
exclamation mark, is one claim with the question, not two. The scorecard is the comma list
again with a question mark in it, and the same short-parts rule that fixes the comma list
covers it once "?" is allowed to end a part.

**Done in `claims-4`** for the question and its answer: a piece of weight 30 or under after
a piece ending in "?" joins it. The scorecard is not: "?" still ends a piece, so "Visuals?
fantastic!, Atmosphere? fantastic!" comes out as one claim per question through the
question-and-answer rule, which is the right count, and the tail "Story? mid at best,
Balance? bad" stays one claim of two.

### Abbreviations the list does not have, reported on 1466860

"Since I've been playing the Def. Editions for a while" cut at "Def.". A capitalised word
after a full stop that follows a three-letter capitalised token is a weaker signal than the
list, but "Def." is not in ABBREVIATIONS and "Ed." is not either. Add both, and consider
treating a one-to-four-letter capitalised token before a full stop, followed by a lowercase
word, as an abbreviation regardless of the list. Goes in `claims-4` with the comma list.

**Done in `claims-4`** as list entries: "def", "ed", "ver", "vers", "esp", "resp", "orig"
and "hrs", and the list is now matched with the dots taken out, so "i.e." and "z.B." are
caught when a capital follows them (the 3551340 labeller found two "i.e." cuts). The
capitalised-token rule is not in, because a lowercase word after "Fun." is how most
reviewers start their next sentence. The same labeller reported "the old Champ." cut before
"Manager", which "champ" would cover if it were an abbreviation anybody else used; it is not
added on one report.

### A heading tag used as bold, reported on 1466860 and 1716740

"The biggest improvement might be [h1]EVERYONE WALK FAST[/h1], really nice" came back as
three claims, the middle one shouting and the other two saying nothing. The Chinese
long-form review on 1716740 does it eleven times: `[h2]` opened after a colon or a comma and
closed before one, so the labeller received claims beginning with "，" and "？". The
splitter treats every heading tag as a break because on Steam a heading is a block, but a
reviewer who opens one mid-sentence wanted emphasis, and the text runs straight through it.

The rule: a heading tag breaks only at a line boundary. An opening tag with nothing but
whitespace between it and the previous line break, or the start of the review, begins a
point; a closing tag with nothing but whitespace between it and the next line break, or the
end, ends one. Anywhere else the tag is styling and is skipped like `[b]`. Every real
heading in the same review still splits, since they all sit on lines of their own. Goes in
`claims-4`.

**Done in `claims-4`**, decided at the opening tag: it is a heading where nothing but markup
has been written since the line began or the last point ended, or where the previous
sentence has ended; otherwise it and its closing tag are styling. A heading then ends with
its closing tag wherever that sits, and weighs what its words weigh, so "Cons" joins the
point under it exactly as "Cons" on a bare line does. In the drawn sets 147 of 150 closing
heading tags are followed by a line break, so the line rule and this one agree everywhere
but in the synthetic cases.

### A line that ends on a comma has not finished, reported on 1809540

A Japanese review of the economy (184812704) came back as thirteen claims, four of them
ending on "、" and the next line starting mid-thought: the writer wrapped long sentences by
hand and never used "。" at all. A line break ends a claim, which is right for lists and
headings and wrong here. The rule: a line ending in a comma (",", "，" or "、") joins the line
after it. A comma is never how anybody ends a point, in any script the splitter handles.
Goes in `claims-4`.

**Done in `claims-4`** as written.

### An emoticon after a sentence joins the wrong neighbour

":D", ":(", ";)" and ":|" sit after the sentence they colour, but a fragment below the
minimum weight joins forward, so "Great fun. :D If you like Vermintide..." hands the smile to
the next claim. Five claims across the drawn sets begin this way. A fragment with no letter
in it, on a line that has one before it, should join backward. Goes in `claims-4`.

**Done in `claims-4`** in both shapes: a token of up to four characters with at most one
letter in it, and at least one that is not a letter, following a sentence end on the same
line is run into that sentence's boundary, and a piece that is only such a token joins the
piece before it. "xD" is the one two-letter emoticon named. A bare letter never counts,
because "A" after a full stop is the next sentence starting. Not covered: an emoji that
opens a line and is followed by words on it (548430 reported a pickaxe and a heart handed
to the line after), because on the next line it is as often that line's bullet.

### A bold heading before a list stood alone, reported on 548430

"The Good:" and "Pro Tips:" came back as claims of their own with their items after them,
though a heading ending in a colon has joined what it introduces since `claims-2`. The
reviews wrote them as `[b][u]The Good[/u][/b]:` followed by `[list]` on a line of its own,
and that bare `[list]` line was a piece: it weighed six characters of markup, took the held
heading, and the two together weighed enough to stand. **Done in `claims-4`**: a run with no
words in it is never a piece, markup weighs nothing, and a heading is read for its colon
with the tags taken out.

### Drawn art cut one line per claim, reported on 916440 and 629730

A fifteen-line braille drawing, a nine-line ASCII hand, a zalgo block: one picture, cut into
a claim per line, each of which is not words at all. Recognisable by what a line is made of
rather than by what it says: a line with no letter or digit in it, in a run of such lines, is
part of a picture. Three or more in a row are one claim, which the reader will decline and
which is the right answer for a drawing. Goes in `claims-5` with the box template.

### Two shapes that may not be fixable mechanically

- A crash log or a poem cut line by line into fragments that say nothing alone.
- One sentence carrying three subjects ("beautiful art and story", "runs well, isn't
  misrepresented, just not for me"). The comma list in `claims-4` takes the ones written as a
  list; a sentence that names three things in ordinary grammar keeps one subject and the model
  learns the rest from context.

### The ballot-box template, reported by four labellers in a row

The copypasta review: `{ Graphics }` and then a column of options, one ticked and the rest
left blank. One on 690790 came back as **58 claims**, one on 774361 as 70, one on 916440 as
65, one on 629730 as 22, and every labeller flagged nearly every fragment. Across every drawn
set it is 8 reviews of 5,760, one in seven hundred, but those eight hold 443 claims, and 346
of them are a box line: **1.8% of every drawn claim** in the whole reference set is a tick
box. It is also what pushed 629730 to a 40.7% mis-split rate, the worst of any game, and
916440 to 29%.

It is mechanically recognisable, which the other noise shapes are not. A line whose first
character is a ballot box (`☐` U+2610, `☑` U+2611, `☒` U+2612) is a template option, and the
rule follows from what the reviewer did:

- An **unticked** option is a line they did not choose. It says nothing and is not a claim.
- A **ticked** option is the answer to the heading above it, so "{ Graphics } ☑ Beautiful" is
  one claim about graphics rather than a heading and a word.
- A run of them under one heading is one claim, not one per box.

Goes in `claims-5`, with whatever the last labellers report, because the whole library has to
be read again after a splitter changes and there is no sense doing that twice.

### A review with no punctuation at all, reported on 553850 and 3551340

"屎 闪退bug 各种奇怪bug 游戏内容太少 难度高无脑堆大怪", four complaints separated by spaces and
nothing else, and the same shape in Turkish, Polish and Czech, plus three English rants of two
hundred words with one full stop between them. The splitter has nothing to cut on: no
terminator, no comma, no line break. Splitting on spaces would shatter every ordinary
sentence, and splitting long runs at a word count would cut mid-thought at a place decided by
arithmetic. This is the shape a splitter cannot reach, and the labellers who reported it
labelled the whole run under its first subject, which is the honest reading.
